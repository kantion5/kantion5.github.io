        Aspring Software Developer looking for their first opportunity.

    <p>
        I enjoy developing many different types of software including desktop applications, websites, and API's. I get a great 
        amount of satisfaction when I launch a fully tested and functional application. I find learning new frameworks, languages and 
        technologies challenging and rewarding. Right now I'm interested in developing the best websites I can and will continue learning 
        new techniques to improve.

        Outside of work, I love to enjoy nature with friends and family.
